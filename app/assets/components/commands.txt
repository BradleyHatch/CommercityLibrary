You'll need to be in the current components directory to use the following commands.




~ Prerequisites ~

Node needs to be installed on your machine.
If you have Homebrew installed just enter 'brew install node', then 'brew upgrade node'.




~ setup ~

All you need to do is download the node packages with 'npm install'.




~ development ~

Use 'npm run development' to have the bundled js file rebuilt on any change in the source.




~ production ~

'npm run build' will do a one off build of your bundled js.




~ overview ~

The code lives in the ./src directory.

When 'npm run build' is run everything in src will be bundled together into one file called 'components.js',
found in the ../javascripts/components directory.

Generic components will need to be added to the generic_components file in src and app specific components to app_components.
You'll need to add them into the switch statement in each file.

Components can be used by calling the 'react_component' partial with a componentId and componentType param.

e.g. =render 'react_component', componentId: 'background-jobs-display', componentType: 'BackgroundJobsDisplay'

componentId - will be used as the id on the components parent div.
componentType - must match the name of the component in the generic/app_components switch statements.
